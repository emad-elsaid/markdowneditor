Markdown Editor
===============


This is an exercise for C++ and Raylib. It should view and edit text like a text
editor and it should also preview the format inline. links should be clickable for example.
images should be loaded and inlined...etc.

So far it renders markdown partially and readonly. scroll with mouse wheel and doesn't wrap text when the line is too long
